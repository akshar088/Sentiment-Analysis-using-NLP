# NLP for Sentiment Analysis  

This project, completed as part of my internship at **YBI Foundation**, focuses on building a sentiment analysis model using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to classify text into **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** sentiments.  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
The aim of this project is to process raw textual data, extract meaningful features, and train machine learning models to accurately predict sentiment. It demonstrates the practical use of NLP in real-world applications like product reviews, social media analysis, and customer feedback systems.  

## ðŸ”¹ Key Steps  
- **Data Preprocessing** â€“ Cleaning text, removing stopwords, tokenization, stemming/lemmatization.  
- **Feature Extraction** â€“ Converting text into numerical vectors using **Bag of Words** and **TF-IDF**.  
- **Model Training** â€“ Implemented classification algorithms such as **Logistic Regression** and **Naive Bayes**.  
- **Evaluation** â€“ Measured accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for performance comparison.  
- **Visualization** â€“ Data distribution, word clouds, and confusion matrices for insights.  

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack  
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, NLTK, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## ðŸ“‚ Use Cases  
- Social media sentiment monitoring  
- Product review analysis  
- Customer feedback classification
